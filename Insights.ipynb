    "\n",
    "#### 1. Precision Delivery Still Has Gaps  \n",
    "Only 8 out of 47 guests reported **complete alignment** between expectations and experience. This reveals **inconsistency in execution** ‚Äî even among guests who received mostly what they asked for.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Over Half of Guests Received Partial Satisfaction  \n",
    "The majority of guests fall into the **40‚Äì80% match range**, meaning they noticed a meaningful gap in delivery. While they may still be satisfied, **these guests are less likely to become loyal or refer others**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Missed Engagement with Some Guests  \n",
    "5 guests did not leave any Check-Out feedback ‚Äî a **10% insight loss**. Whether due to timing, survey format, or disengagement, this indicates a need for a better **feedback loop**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "### üîß Strategic Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "| Focus Area           | Action Step                                                                 |\n",
    "|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n",
    "| **Operational Focus** | Identify and strengthen weaker service categories that frequently go unmatched |\n",
    "| **Tier-Based Service Reviews** | Use these match tiers in staff reviews to drive accountability by theme |\n",
    "| **Feedback Completion** | Implement reminder nudges or rewards to improve Check-Out response rates |\n",
    "| **Recovery Strategy** | Proactively follow up with guests whose alignment falls below 40%            |\n",

    "### üéØ Bottom Line\n",
    "\n",
    "This tiered alignment model goes beyond general feedback trends and shows **how well the hotel is delivering per guest**. The findings suggest:\n",
    "- **Solid coverage of expectations**, but not with enough consistency.\n",
    "- A need for **better feedback capture** and **theme-specific service assurance**.\n",
    "\n",
    "With targeted improvements, the hotel can boost full alignment rates ‚Äî a strong driver of retention, referrals, and reputation."
